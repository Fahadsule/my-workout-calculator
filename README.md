This is my personal fun Calculator for my powerlifting.
Iam writing code to just help me with repetitive weight tracking and attempt weights.
The method used is mainly the Texas method routine so its a bit personal there.
you can replace the google sheets on sheets.py with your own training data if you too use texas method
the assumptions are that you use similar schema so you can use the sheets template in the code and it surely is compatible
